## Technologies
I will use each of these following technologies in my project.
- **HTML** - Provides the correct structre for the site. There will be 3-4 HTML pages. One for login, the home page, and others for the goal setting/making/reflecting.
- **CSS** - Applies the styling and design that will provide a good color, shape, and contrast to the page.
- **React** - Works the login, goal-setting games, display of goals, and interactive surveys.
- **Service** - Backend service for each of the following:
    - login credentials
    - saved user goals
- **DB/Login** - Registers login, and secures user goals and credentials
- **WebSocket** - Displays accomplished goals in the achievements log 

## HTML deliverable ðŸš€
Here is the required information for my Startup HTML

I created a foundation for my project, leaving connections to let CSS, JavaScript, and Websockets to build off of it.

To be more Specific:

- [x] **HTML pages** - I made 5 HTML pages - Login *(index.html)*, Home *(goals.html)*, Goalsetting *(plan.html)*, Brainstorming *(ideas.html)*, and Reviewing *(review.html)*.
- [x] **Links** - There is a nav bar to the Login and Home page on each page, the other three have various links in the Home page. There are also links to help the user through the goalsetting process.
- [x] **Text** - There is representational text given in place of goal names, descriptions, and dates. These will later be inputs from the user.
- [ ] **Images** - Other than the favicon, I didn't really have any reason to include images.
- [x] **DB/Login** - Input for name, email and password are set for login. The different goals/ideas given from the user will also be stored in the database.
- [x] **WebSocket** - There is an achievments log that will display when any user completes a given task (make goal, accomplish goal, etc).

*I also have comments within my code to help explain functions*
